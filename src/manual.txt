How to start this?

Watch kevin wood. he will revise you from basics and the codes he took are from the documentation. DO NOT follow his entire tutorial -->pitch for extortion
Always have the docs open in your side

always create a src in workstation. then go to that src and create packages not in the base directory of workstation

remember to look into these commands importantly
1. ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --node-name <node_name> <package_name> --dependencies <dependencies : like rclpy>
2. colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select <package_name> (symlink install to create symlinks --> ensures you need not to do colcon build for
every changes) (you can also use --executor sequential to prevent the computer from overloading)
3. always: source ./install/local_setup.zsh from the base directory this will connect then properly with the terminal

points to remember:
1. package.xml should be properly updated
2. setup.py should be properly updated

Most issues happen with the bus names (like topic name, service bus names) check them first. Then check the setup.py and package.xml

Remember when you add dependencies, use <exec_depend> in package.xml for pure pyhton dependencies (as python files dont need building unlike Cpp packages -->if thats the case use <build>). Also the ros2 pkg create .... --dependencies creates <depend> not <exec_depend> so be careful.


Here is the order you should follow for revision:
1. Kevin wood basic theory introduction
2. py_pubsub
3. py_srvcli
4. tutorial_interfaces then new_format_msg
5. python_parameters
6. action docs
7. launch ->py_launch_ex (along with docs) ->launch_tutorial
